     * UPLOADED FILES ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION, and cannot be listed.

     * They are served by the API's `/static` mount, which in development is

     * hosts outright as an SSRF guard, so a `remotePatterns` entry for one is
     * accepted by the config and then refused at request time with `"url"
     * parameter is not allowed`. Verified: an entry for `probe.example.com`
     * matches (and fails on the unreachable host), the identical entry for
     * `127.0.0.1:5001` does not match at all.
     *
     * `FilePreview` therefore renders attachments `unoptimized`, which works
     * in every environment rather than only where the API has a public
     * hostname. `fill` + `sizes` still give it the layout box, so there is no
     * shift; what is given up is the resize and the AVIF/WebP re-encode.
