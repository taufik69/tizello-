/*
 * The interactive half of the members screen. The page above it stays a Server
 * Component and hands both fetched lists down as props; this leaf owns what a
 * static tree cannot: which tab is up, the roster as edited, the outstanding
 * invitations, and which removal is awaiting confirmation.
 *
 * Both arrays live here rather than in their panels because the tab strip
 * renders their counts. The panels below own only their own dialogs.
 *
 * **Everything on this screen is REAL.** Invite and cancel go through
 * `invitation-actions.ts`; role change and remove go through `member-actions.ts`
 * by way of `useMemberMutations`. Each action calls the API and revalidates this
 * route, which is what makes a change survive a reload; each list is also held
 * in state, which is what makes it immediate.
 *
 * `viewerRole` is what decides whether a row's controls are drawn at all. It is
 * a MIRROR of the API's permission table (`lib/roles.ts`) and draws controls
 * only — `requirePermission` on the server is what allows anything.

     The row is added only AFTER the action succeeds, not optimistically. An

     already invited, no permission — and showing a row that then disappears is
     worse than a half-second wait. `new Date()` is safe here: this runs in an
