/*
 * Flat and bordered, exactly like `MemberRow` — the two lists sit behind the
 * same tab strip and have to read as one list grammar, not two. Same stack to
 * `flex-col` below `sm`, for the same reason: a single line at 360px would
 * have to choose between a truncated address and a clipped menu.
 *
 * NO AVATAR, deliberately. A pending invitation has no person behind it — no
 * account, no name, nothing to draw initials from. Building a disc out of the
 * local part of the address would invent an identity that does not exist yet,
 * so the address leads the row and the discs start when someone accepts.
