/*
 * One kanban column, and the drop zone inside it.
 *
 * `w-list` is Trello's 272px, the same width every other column in this app
 * uses.
 *
 * THERE IS NO DROPPABLE HERE ANY MORE. A column used to register itself with
 * @dnd-kit and be told when it was the target; now `lib/board-drag.ts` resolves
 * the target from geometry the board measured once, and this component is told
 * the answer. `data-column` and `data-cards` are what that measurement reads —
 * the section for the column's horizontal span, the list for where its cards
 * begin, which an EMPTY column has no card to supply.
 *
 * `STATUS_BAR` is reused for the lit state rather than a new pair: it is
 * already "a tinted fill for recognition, a hairline in the strong token for
 * the edge", measured against `surface`, which is exactly this job.
 *
 * `min-h-28` KEEPS AN EMPTY COLUMN A TARGET WORTH AIMING AT. Its older job was
 * breaking a feedback loop — a track that shrank when its empty state
 * unmounted moved its own bottom edge out from under the cursor, undoing the
 * collision that started the move. That loop is gone by construction now
 * (nothing reflows mid-drag), but a 0px-tall drop zone is still a bad one.
