/**
 * Grab the board's background and drag it sideways.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the rail's horizontal scrollbar is hidden
 * (`scrollbar-hidden`), so something else has to advertise and provide the
 * scroll. A mouse wheel alone does not — a vertical wheel over a horizontal
 * overflow does nothing without Shift, which nobody discovers. Grab-and-drag
 * is the gesture every board tool uses for exactly this (Figma's canvas,
 * Trello's rail), and a `cursor-grab` on the background is the advertisement.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT TOUCH. A card is dnd-kit's, and the two gestures start
 * identically — press, then move. They are told apart by WHERE the press
 * landed rather than by how far it travelled, because a threshold race would
 * make the outcome depend on how fast the pointer left the card. `IGNORE`
 * lists what belongs to something else: any card (`li`), any real control, and
 * anything in the top layer. Everything else — the gaps between columns, a
 * column heading, the empty space in a track — is background.
 *
 * POINTER CAPTURE, so a pan that runs off the rail keeps tracking instead of
 * stopping at the edge. That is most of a real pan: you grab near one end and
 * pull past the viewport.
 *
 * `scrollLeft` IS SET DIRECTLY, not through state. It is not React's value to
 * own — the browser already stores it on the element, and routing 60 frames a
 * second of it through a render would re-render six columns of cards per frame
 * for a number nothing else reads. Only `panning`, which the cursor depends
 * on, is state.
