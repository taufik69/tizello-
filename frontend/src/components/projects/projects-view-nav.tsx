/*
 * NAVIGATION, not a tabs widget.
 *
 * Switching a view changes the URL, so each of these is a real `<a>` inside a
 * `<nav>`, and the current one carries `aria-current="page"`. Deliberately NOT
 * `role="tablist"` / `role="tab"`, and deliberately not `ui/tabs.tsx`: that
 * primitive is for co-located panels in one document, and `role="tab"` on a
 * link that navigates tells a screen-reader user the page will not move when
 * it is about to.
 *
 * The payoff is that all five views stay server-rendered with zero client JS
 * for the switch, and every view is linkable, bookmarkable and back-buttonable.
 *
 * The visible label is short; `aria-label` gives the full one ("Status" →
 * "Status breakdown"). The visible text opens the accessible name, so
 * voice control still matches on what is on screen.
