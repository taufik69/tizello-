/**
 * The Icon row — the emoji alone, with no colour control anywhere in it.
 *
 * Icon and colour used to share ONE row behind a popover reading "Chosen", on
 * the argument that the full `WorkspaceAppearancePicker` was too tall to
 * inline. That argument was about the picker, not about the two decisions:
 * they are independent (a colour with no icon is a valid swatch, an icon with
 * no colour is a valid glyph), and folding them together meant two clicks and
 * a panel to change either one.
 *
 * So each is its own row now, and each is INLINE rather than behind a popover.
 * Six quick emoji, the full picker and a shuffle fit on one 36px line — the
 * same height as every other value control in the list, which is what the
 * popover was buying in the first place.
 *
 * Clicking the chosen emoji again clears it. That is the only route back to
 * "no icon", and it is the same gesture `WorkspaceAppearancePicker` uses.
