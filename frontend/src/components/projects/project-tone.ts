/*
 * Every colour the Projects views use, as COMPLETE class strings.
 *
 * Nothing here is built by interpolation — `` `bg-${status}-subtle` `` would
 * not survive Tailwind's plain-text scan of this file, so a status would
 * silently render unstyled. Five lookups, one per role the colour plays.
 *
 * The ink is `text-text-muted` on every chip, and that is the finding rather
 * than a shortcut. Measured against the token values in DESIGN-SYSTEM.md at
 * 11px, a `-subtle` fill does NOT pair with its own strong token:
 *
 *   text-success on bg-success-subtle   2.82:1 light  — fails AA
 *   text-warning on bg-warning-subtle   3.27:1 light  — fails AA
 *   text-info    on bg-info-subtle      4.63:1 light  — passes, barely
 *   text-text-muted on ANY of them      5.70–6.44:1 both themes
 *
 * So the hue is carried by the fill, which is the part that has to be
 * recognisable at a glance, and the ink is the one value that clears AA on all
 * six fills in both themes. The strong tokens still appear — as dots, ring arcs
 * and bar rails, where the bar is 3:1 rather than 4.5:1.

/**
 * Chip fill + soft edge + ink. Composed onto `BADGE_BASE`, which sets no colour.
 *
 * THE BORDER IS THE STRONG TOKEN AT 40%, not a seventh set of tokens. A
 * `-subtle` fill on `surface` is a 1.06:1 edge — the chip has no outline at
 * all, so on a board card it dissolves into the card it sits on. The strong
 * token at full strength is the opposite problem: `border-success` beside
 * `bg-success-subtle` reads as a bordered button rather than a label.
 *
 * `border-success/25` is `color-mix(…, transparent)` over whatever the fill
 * resolves to, so it lands between the two — a green chip whose edge is
 * unmistakably the same green, in both themes, from one declaration. It is
 * DECORATIVE, which is what makes 25% acceptable: the word carries the
 * meaning and the fill carries recognition, so the edge has no 3:1 to clear.
 * The dots and bars below still use the strong token undiluted, because those
 * ARE the indicator.
 *
 * 25% AND NOT 40%: at 40 the hairline was reading as the chip's subject rather
 * than its edge — on a dark surface a 40% amber outline is brighter than the
 * fill it bounds, so an "On hold" chip looked outlined rather than tinted. A
 * quarter strength still names the hue and lets the fill stay the loudest part
 * of the chip.
 *
 * BACKLOG stays neutral, on `border-border` — there is no hue to soften, and
 * the point of the neutral chip is that it is the absence of one.
