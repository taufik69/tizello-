 * How much of the sprint is done: a rail, a fill, and the same numbers written

 *
 * The bar is `aria-hidden`. Its width is the visual encoding of "3 of 8", which
 * the label already states as real text, so announcing it twice would only add
 * noise — the same call `TimelineRow` makes about its bar. `role="progressbar"`
 * would be the alternative, and it would say the identical thing a second time.
 *
 * `width` is `style` because it is a computed percentage — the one dynamic
 * value the house rules allow. Everything else is a utility.
