 * What is in the sprint: how many tasks, and what they add up to.
 *
 * Both chips are neutral. The state chip on the same row already owns a colour,
 * and a second tinted pill would compete with it for the same glance —
 * `StoryPointsBadge` makes the identical call on a backlog row, and this is the
 * same number in the same typeface.
 *
 * A sprint with nothing in it says so. `0 items · 0 pts` is technically true
 * and reads as a bug; "Nothing planned yet" is the sentence a booked, empty
 * time-box actually deserves.
