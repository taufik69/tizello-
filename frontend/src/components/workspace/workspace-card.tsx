/**
 * The whole card is one hit target, but it is NOT one `<a>` any more: the
 * actions menu in the corner is a `<button>`, and a button inside an anchor is
 * invalid HTML that browsers resolve by dropping one of them. The title carries
 * the link and `after:absolute after:inset-0` stretches its hit area over the
 * card; the menu sits above that overlay on its own stacking context. Focus
 * lands on the title and on the menu — two stops, both visible — rather than on
 * one anchor wrapping everything.
 *
 * `memberCount` / `projects` are fixture-only (see types/workspace.ts) — a
 * real, API-sourced workspace has neither, so the footer falls back to the
 * description and the meta line to the slug rather than rendering "undefined
 * projects".
