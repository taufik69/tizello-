/*
 * The strip above the workspace list: how it is drawn, and whether archived
 * workspaces are in it.
 *
 * NAVIGATION, not a tabs widget — both controls change the URL, so each is a
 * real `<a>` inside a `<nav>` and the current one carries `aria-current`.
 * Deliberately not `ui/tabs.tsx`: `role="tab"` on a link that navigates tells a
 * screen-reader user the page will not move when it is about to. The payoff is
 * that both views stay server-rendered with zero client JS for the switch, and
 * "my archived workspaces as a list" is a URL somebody can bookmark.
 *
 * The archived link is the only way back to a workspace that has been archived
 * — the API omits archived rows from the default list entirely — so it is a
 * permanent part of the strip rather than something that appears once there is
 * something in it. A count would need a second request to know.
