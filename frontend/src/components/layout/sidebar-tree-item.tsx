/*
 * A nav item that carries sub-views: a disclosure over the same `?view=` links
 * the page's view strip offers, plus the row actions the group would own.
 *
 * The row is a flex container, NOT a link with buttons inside it — a button
 * nested in an anchor is invalid, and the three controls here (toggle, link,
 * two locked actions) are four separate targets. The fill therefore sits on the
 * container and the link stays transparent, which is the only difference from
 * `SidebarItem`'s treatment.
 *
 * `aria-current` moves: while the group is open the current CHILD carries it,
 * so the row is styled active without claiming to be the page. Collapsed, the
 * row takes it back — it is then the only thing on screen naming the page.
 *
 * THE FILL MOVES WITH IT, for a group whose children are routes. Projects'
 * children live under the parent's own path, so parent and child being lit
 * together reads correctly — one page, one section of it. Planning's do not:
 * `Current sprint` IS `/board/sprint`, so lighting the parent as well drew two
 * highlighted rows for one page and made the group look like it had two current
 * items. When a child claims the path, the parent steps back to its idle
 * treatment and the child alone carries the state.
 *
 * THE ICON SLOT IS THE TOGGLE, and that is the fix for a row that did not line
 * up with its own siblings. The chevron used to sit in front of the icon, which
 * pushed this item's glyph to 32px while every plain `SidebarItem` beside it
 * kept its own at 8px — one row in the list visibly indented for no reason a
 * reader could see. Giving the chevron its own gutter would have meant
 * indenting all six siblings to match, for the sake of the one item that has
 * children.
 *
 * So the two glyphs share ONE 16px slot at 8px, exactly where a sibling's icon
 * is: the icon at rest, the chevron once the row is hovered or holds focus.
 * That is Notion's page-tree behaviour and it costs nothing — the expanded
 * children are what say the group is open, so the chevron does not have to be
 * on screen to report it.
 *
 * A 16px BUTTON IS TOO SMALL A TARGET, so `before:-inset-1.5` grows the hit
 * area to 28px without moving the glyph. The alternative — a `size-7` button —
 * would push the icon back off the 8px line this whole change is about.
 *
 * THE TWO ROW ACTIONS ARE HOVER-REVEALED for the same reason Notion hides
 * them: a `+` and a `⋯` on every row is four permanent glyphs of chrome in a
 * 256px column, and they are the least likely thing in it to be wanted.
 * `group-focus-within` is what keeps them reachable from the keyboard.
 *
 * They are also OPT-IN, via `rowActions`. They were written for Projects, where
 * "new project" and "project actions" are real operations the group owns.
 * Planning owns nothing: its children are three fixed screens of one sprint
 * workflow, and a `+` there would promise a "new backlog" that is not a thing.
 * A disclosure is a shape, not a licence to create.
