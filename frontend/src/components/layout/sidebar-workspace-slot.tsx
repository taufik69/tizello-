/**
 * The client seam that tells the switcher which shape the sidebar is in.
 *
 * `SidebarWorkspace` fetches on the server and cannot read context; the
 * switcher is a client component but lives in `components/workspace/`, and
 * having it reach into `components/layout/` for the sidebar's context would
 * invert the dependency — a workspace control would stop working anywhere but
 * this sidebar. So the coupling lives HERE, in the layout folder that already
 * owns the context, and the switcher takes a plain `compact` boolean.
 *
 * `workspaces` crosses the boundary as plain serialisable data, which is what
 * keeps the `GET /workspaces` on the server.
