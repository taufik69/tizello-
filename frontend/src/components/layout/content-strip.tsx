/**
 * The slim strip above the page. The page label on the left, behind the one
 * control that puts the sidebar back: the hamburger, below `md`.
 *
 * There is no expand button here any more. It existed because collapsing HID
 * the sidebar, so the only way back had to live somewhere else; the rail keeps
 * its own toggle, and two controls for one thing in two places is worse than
 * one where it belongs.
 *
 * The label is orientation only — the breadcrumb proper lives in the content
 * column, as the page's heading. The theme control and the account menu
 * sit at the far right; `ml-auto` on that group is what pushes them there. The
 * account menu used to be `SidebarAccount`, pinned to the sidebar's bottom
 * edge; it moved up here to sit beside the theme control, per the reference
 * layout.
