/*
 * A right-hand peek panel — Notion's, not a centred modal.
 *
 * Built on the native `<dialog>` with `showModal()`, exactly as `ui/dialog.tsx`
 * is, and for the same payoff: focus trapping, Esc-to-close, inertness of the
 * page behind, and the top layer, with no portal, no scroll lock and no
 * dependency. The difference is purely where it sits — `ml-auto` with a full
 * height instead of `m-auto` with a max width.
 *
 * A SEPARATE FILE rather than a `side` prop on `Dialog`: the two differ in
 * their entrance animation, their close affordance (a drawer carries its own
 * ✕, a dialog is dismissed by its footer) and their scroll behaviour, and
 * threading three conditionals through `Dialog` to save one file would make
 * the common case harder to read.
 *
 * Tailwind's preflight zeroes margins, which removes the UA's `margin: auto` —
 * hence the explicit `ml-auto` below rather than relying on the default.
 */
/*
 * `flex flex-col` plus a `flex-1` body is what pins the footer to the BOTTOM
 * of the panel rather than to the bottom of the content. `sticky bottom-0`
 * alone does not: sticky only engages once there is something to scroll, so on
 * a short form the footer floated up under the last field.
 */
/*
 * `[&:not([open])]:hidden` is load-bearing, and its absence was a real bug.
 *
 * The UA stylesheet hides a closed dialog with `dialog:not([open]) { display:
 * none }`. That is an element selector — specificity (0,0,1) — so the `flex`
 * this panel needs for its header/body/footer column BEAT it, and every closed
 * drawer rendered inline, in flow, one after another down the page. With a
 * "+ New project" trigger in every board column and every status group, that
 * was six invisible-by-design panels all painting at once.
 *
 * The fix is a selector that outranks `flex` rather than an ordering the build
 * might change: `.[&:not([open])]:hidden:not([open])` is (0,2,0) against
 * `.flex`'s (0,1,0), so it wins whichever order they land in.
 */
/*
 * TWO POSITIONS, ONE ELEMENT.
 *
 * `drawer` is the right-hand peek panel; `modal` is the same panel centred. It
 * is deliberately a class swap on one `<dialog>` rather than two components,
 * because the choice is live — `SurfaceMenu` flips it while the panel is open
 * — and rendering a different component type there would unmount the form
 * mid-edit and take every uncontrolled field with it. Swapping `className`
 * keeps the same DOM node, so React reconciles the children rather than
 * replacing them, and the CSS animation restarts on its own because the
 * `animation-name` changed.
 *
 * The two strings are written out in full rather than composed from a shared
 * base plus overrides. `cn` is a plain join (see `lib/cn.ts` — no
 * `tailwind-merge`), so `rounded-none` after `rounded-xl` would be two
 * utilities of equal specificity with stylesheet order picking the winner.
 *
 * `text-start` is load-bearing for the reason `ui/dialog.tsx` documents at
 * length: a `<dialog>` paints in the top layer but inherits from its DOM
 * ancestors, and this one is opened from a `<td className="text-right">` on
 * every table row. Without it the entire edit drawer — every property label,
 * every value — rendered right-aligned.
