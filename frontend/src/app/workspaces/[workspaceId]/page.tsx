/**
 * Feature 1 — one workspace, read from `GET /workspaces/:id` rather than from
 * `demo-data.ts`.
 *
 * `getWorkspace` answers `null` for a workspace that does not exist, one that
 * has been soft-deleted, and one the caller is not a member of — the API
 * collapses all three into the same `404` deliberately, so that nobody can
 * probe for the existence of a workspace they cannot see. `notFound()` renders
 * this segment's `not-found.tsx` for all three.
 *
 * The workspace list alongside it is what the header's Switch menu needs
 * (feature 5), and it is fetched here rather than inside that menu so the whole
 * header stays a Server Component. `includeArchived` is on: an archived
 * workspace you are currently looking at has to appear in its own switcher.
