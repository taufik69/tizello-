/*
 * The tail of the sidebar: the companion apps, then the utility rows.
 *
 * Nothing here is a route in this package — a calendar client and a desktop
 * shell are separate products, and the rest are screens that do not exist yet
 * — so every item is listed WITHOUT an href. `SidebarItem` then renders it as
 * a genuinely disabled button carrying its reason as a `title` and a "Soon"
 * badge, which is the honest shape for "coming soon": visible, explained, and
 * not a dead link.
 *
 * Its own file because `nav-links.ts` would pass the 150-line cap.
