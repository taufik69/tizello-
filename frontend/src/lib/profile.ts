 * The profile API — `backend/docs/api/user.md`.
 *
 * Two endpoints, both `/users/me`, both about the signed-in account and nobody
 * else. There is deliberately no `getProfile(id)`: the API has no `/users/:id`,
 * because a profile is edited only by the person it belongs to and the identity
 * comes from the token rather than a path. Reading another member's display
 * fields is the workspace roster's job (`lib/members.ts`).
 *
 * **Email is not here.** It is the login identity and the address an invitation
 * is bound to; changing it is a flow with its own tokens, not a field on a
 * form. The API refuses the key rather than ignoring it, so sending one is a
 * `400` — which is why nothing below can construct a body containing it.
