/*
 * Where an uploaded file is READ from.
 *
 * The API serves the upload directory twice, and this module is the frontend's
 * side of that decision (`backend/docs/api/upload.md` §Two read paths):
 *
 * - `GET /api/v1/uploads/:name` — behind `authGuard`, session-scoped.
 * - `GET /static/:name` — `express.static`, PUBLIC. This is the one used here.
 *
 * PUBLIC IS THE POINT AND ALSO THE COST. A `<img src>` cannot carry the app's
 * session: the cookies are httpOnly on the Next origin, so a browser request
 * to the API is cross-origin and arrives with nothing. The authenticated route
 * therefore needed a same-origin proxy in front of it, which meant every byte
 * of every attachment travelled through this process. The static mount removes
 * that hop — and makes any file readable by anyone holding its URL. The names
 * are UUIDs, so they are unguessable, but a leaked URL is permanent access.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because the browser is what resolves these — unlike
 * `API_BASE_URL`, which is server-only precisely because the browser never
 * talks to the API directly. It still does not: it talks to a static file
 * server that happens to share the API's origin.
