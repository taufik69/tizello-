 * The whole auth surface. Every function here is one endpoint from spec §9 and
 * keeps the signature it had as a fixture, so this cutover was "a change to this
 * file and nothing else" — the callers in `lib/actions/` are untouched.
 *
 * **The session is no longer ours to mint.** The fixture set a `tizello_session`
 * cookie holding a user id, which was fine when the id *was* the credential.
 * The API now issues `tizello_access` and `tizello_refresh`, both `httpOnly`,
 * and `api-client.ts` forwards them through. Nothing in this app invents,
 * signs or reads a session value any more — which is why the fixture's
 * `startSession` is gone rather than emptied: a function that exists to do
 * nothing invites someone to make it do something.
 *
 * This is the one module in `src/lib/` outside `lib/actions/` that imports
 * `next/*`: spec §10 puts the session read here so a Server Component can
 * `await getSession()` directly.
