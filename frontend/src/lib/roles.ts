 * what is allowed. A stale copy here shows someone a menu item that comes back
 * `403` — annoying, not a hole.
 *
 * Deliberately two named predicates rather than a `hasPermission(role, string)`
 * port: the frontend gates exactly two actions, and a stringly-typed lookup
 * would let a typo silently fail open at the call site.
