 * The member API — `backend/docs/api/member.md`. Replaces `demo-members.ts`.
 *
 * Three endpoints, all under `/workspaces/:workspaceId/members`, and
 * **deliberately no create**: the only way into a workspace is an invitation the
 * recipient accepts (`lib/invites.ts`, `backend/docs/api/invitation.md`). The
 * API has no `POST /members` to call — one taking a `userId` would put somebody
 * in a workspace without their consent, and would need a
 * user-lookup-by-email endpoint to be usable at all.
 *
 * The READ is not re-implemented here. `getWorkspaceMembers` in
 * `lib/workspaces.ts` already calls `GET .../members` for the project screens,
 * which want the raw row; this file maps that row to the `WorkspaceMember` the
 * roster renders. One fetch, two shapes — a second `fetch` of the same path
 * would be a second place to fix when the endpoint changes.
