/*
 * Every member write. Thin by rule: validate, call a plain function from
 * `lib/members.ts`, revalidate. The rules themselves live on the server — who
 * may change a role, that the owner is untouchable, that you cannot act on your
 * own row, that a project owner cannot be removed — and are documented in
 * `backend/docs/api/member.md`.
 *
 * **Each action returns a plain serialisable result rather than throwing.** These
 * are called from client leaves that render the outcome as a toast; a thrown
 * error there produces an error boundary and loses the roster the user was
 * looking at.
 *
 * Both actions revalidate `/workspaces/:id/members`, which is what makes a
 * change survive a reload. The calling leaf also updates its own copy of the
 * roster, which is what makes it immediate — see `use-member-mutations.ts`.
 * The permissions screen reads the same roster, so it is revalidated too: a
 * role changed on one of the two screens must not leave the other showing the
 * old chip.
