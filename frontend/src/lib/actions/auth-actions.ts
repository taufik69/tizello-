     describes: no verification email is ever sent on this path, so they would
     wait on one that never arrives and `/login` would answer
     EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED. They are already signed in.

     The destination is HOME, not `next`: `next` is the invitation page, and
     the invitation has just been accepted, so sending them back there shows

     and the only destination that currently sets one is `/invite/<token>` —
     which is reachable again from the invite page once the address is
     confirmed. Add it when a second caller needs it.

     Reaching here *with* an `inviteToken` means the API declined to apply it,
     and the ordinary reason is the address: an invitation is bound to the one
     it was sent to, and the public lookup deliberately does not disclose it, so
     the form cannot pre-fill or check it. The account is real and the
     invitation is untouched — say so on the next screen rather than letting
