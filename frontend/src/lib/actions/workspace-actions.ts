 * Every workspace write. Thin by rule: validate, call a plain function from

 * see `backend/docs/api/workspace.md`.
 *
 * Plain arguments, not `(prevState, formData)` — these are called from
 * `useTransition` event handlers, the same shape as `inviteMemberAction`, not
 * from a `<form action>`. That is what lets a dialog branch on the result and
 * close itself synchronously in the handler instead of watching for success in
 * a `useEffect`, which would trip `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` the moment
 * it called the parent's `onOpenChange`.
 *
 * **Permissions are not checked here.** `canUpdateWorkspace` / `canDeleteWorkspace`
 * in `lib/roles.ts` decide which controls are drawn; the API's
 * `requirePermission` is what actually enforces them, and its `403` arrives
 * back as `code: "FORBIDDEN"`.
