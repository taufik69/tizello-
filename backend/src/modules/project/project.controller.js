/**
 * HTTP edge of the project module: read `req`, call the service, respond via
 * `ApiResponse`. No business logic, no Prisma, no `try/catch` — `asyncHandler`
 * at the routes layer forwards a rejection to the error middleware.
 *
 * `getById` passes `req.project` and `req.projectRole` straight through rather
 * than re-fetching by id: `loadProject` already loaded the row to decide
 * whether this request was allowed at all, and a second read of the same row
 * can only disagree with the one authorization was based on.
 *
 * See .claude/skills/api-response/SKILL.md and docs/api/project.md
