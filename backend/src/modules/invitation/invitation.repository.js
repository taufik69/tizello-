/**
 * Every Prisma call the invitation module makes.
 *
 * **This repository writes `Membership` rows, a table it does not otherwise
 * own.** That is a deliberate divergence from "one repository per module".
 * Accepting an invitation is a single atomic operation — create the membership,
 * close the invitation — and splitting it across two repositories would put the
 * transaction boundary in the wrong place, between two calls that must not be
 * separable. The rule is *one repository per module*, not one table per module
 * (§6.8).
 *
 * Lookups are by `tokenHash`; nothing here receives a raw token.
