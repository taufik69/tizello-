/**
 * Row → response shaping for invitations.
 *
 * **Status is derived here, never stored.** There is no `status` column: a
 * second source of truth drifts the moment one write path forgets to update it,
 * and the four timestamps that actually record what happened are the ones an
 * audit needs anyway (§3.6).
 *
 * The order of the checks is the contract, not an implementation detail. A row
 * can carry several of these at once — a revoked invitation that has also
 * expired, an accepted one whose `expiresAt` has since passed — and the first
 * match wins. Reordering silently changes what the members screen reports about
 * rows nobody is looking at until they are.
 *
 * See docs/api/invitation.md and .claude/specs/auth/auth.sprint7.md §7.4
