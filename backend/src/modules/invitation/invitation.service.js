/**
 * Invitation business rules — the admin side (sprint 7) and the recipient side
 * (sprint 8).
 *
 * Two rules shape almost everything below.
 *
 * **1. Dead invitations are indistinguishable from ones that never existed.**
 * Revoked, declined, already-accepted and never-minted all answer `404` on the
 * public lookup. The frontend's `InvitationLookup` type has exactly three
 * states, and the shipped copy for `UNKNOWN` already reads *"mistyped,
 * cancelled, or already used"* — inventing a fourth state breaks the page rather
 * than informing it. It also matters for security: distinguishing *revoked* from
 * *never existed* tells a token-guesser that a token was once real.
 *
 * **2. Accepting is idempotent.** A double-clicked Accept, a retried request, a
 * user already in the workspace — all return `200` with the membership. Reporting
 * failure for something that already succeeded is worse than doing nothing.
 *
 * See docs/api/invitation.md, .claude/specs/auth/auth.sprint7.md and auth.sprint8.md
