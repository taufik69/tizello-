/**
 * Row → response shaping for workspace memberships. A whitelist, like
 * `workspace.dto.js` and `auth.dto.js` — never a `delete row.field` blacklist,
 * so a column added to `Membership` later cannot leak by default.
 *
 * Moved here unchanged from `workspace.dto.js#toWorkspaceMember`: the roster's
 * writes live in this module, and a response shape whose read is in one module
 * and whose writes are in another has two owners and therefore none. The shape
 * is byte-identical to what shipped, because the frontend already parses it
 * (`frontend/src/lib/workspaces.ts#getWorkspaceMembers`).
 *
 * `id` is the MEMBERSHIP, `userId` is the person — and `userId` is what every
 * other endpoint takes (adding a project member, transferring ownership), so a
 * client that confuses the two gets a 404 rather than silent nonsense. This
 * module's `:memberId` is the former.
 *
 * See docs/api/member.md and .claude/plan/member.md §2.2
