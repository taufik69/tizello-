/**
 * Member business rules: the roster read, role changes, and removal.
 *
 * **Authorization is not this file's job.** `loadMembership` and
 * `requirePermission` (shared/middlewares/permission.js) have already run by the
 * time anything below executes, so there is no role check here — every guard in
 * this file is about *state*: who the TARGET is, not what the caller may do.
 * The two questions are separate, and a `role === 'ADMIN'` test in a service is
 * how the permission table stops being the answer to "who may do this".
 *
 * Three rules shape almost everything below.
 *
 * **1. Membership is the only fact about who is in a workspace.** There is no
 * `Workspace.ownerId` column — "the owner" is the membership whose role is
 * OWNER. A workspace with no OWNER membership is unrecoverable: nothing can
 * delete it, bill it, or change a role in it, because each needs a permission
 * only OWNER holds. Everything that could reduce the owner count is refused.
 *
 * **2. Unknown and elsewhere are the same answer.** A `:memberId` that never
 * existed and one that is live in ANOTHER workspace both answer `404`.
 * Answering `403` on the second confirms to an admin of workspace A that a
 * membership id is live in workspace B — a membership-existence oracle across a
 * trust boundary, the same leak `loadMembership` refuses by `404`-ing a
 * non-member.
 *
 * **3. Removal is not idempotent; a role change is.** A second `DELETE` on the
 * same id answers `404`, because a membership id is not a stable handle for a
 * person — it is gone, and the next invitation mints a new one. Setting a role a
 * member already holds succeeds. The asymmetry is which mistake is worse:
 * reporting success for a removal that did not happen tells an admin someone is
 * out when they are not.
 *
 * See docs/api/member.md and .claude/plan/member.md §§2.3-2.6
