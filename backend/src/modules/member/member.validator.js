/**
 * Joi schemas for the member module — request shape only. Authorization is

 *
 * The `role` restriction is the one rule that is more than shape, and it is
 * duplicated in the service on purpose — the same call
 * `invitation.validator.js` makes, for the same reason. An endpoint that can
 * mint an OWNER is a privilege-escalation endpoint, and a validator only
 * protects callers that arrive over HTTP: the service is reachable from a
 * worker, a script, or another service.
