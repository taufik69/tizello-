/**
 * Every Prisma call the member module makes. No business rules — the service

 * **This repository reads `Project` and writes `ProjectMember`, tables the
 * project module owns.** That is a deliberate divergence from "one repository
 * per module", and the same one `invitation.repository.js` takes when it writes
 * `Membership`: removing someone from a workspace must strip their project rows
 * in the SAME transaction, and splitting that across two repositories would put
 * the transaction boundary between two statements that must not be separable.
 * The rule is *one repository per module*, not one table per module.
