/**
 * Every auth business rule. Throws `AppError` with an explicit `data.code`;
 * never touches `req` or `res`, so each function is equally callable from a
 * controller, a worker, or the OAuth callback.
 *
 * Three rules run through the whole file and explain most of what looks odd:
 *
 * 1. **Uniform failure on the credential paths.** Login answers
 *    `INVALID_CREDENTIALS` for a wrong password and for an address with no
 *    account, and compares against a dummy hash in the second case so the two
 *    take the same time (spec §8). Splitting either the message or the timing
 *    rebuilds the user-enumeration oracle the shared answer exists to remove.
 * 2. **Raw secrets are never stored and never logged.** A token exists in
 *    memory, in the response or job payload that carries it, and as a hash in
 *    the database — nowhere else.
 * 3. **Sessions are rows, not claims.** Issuing a session writes a
 *    `RefreshToken`, so it can be revoked; the access token cannot be, which is
 *    the entire reason it lives 15 minutes.
 *
 * See .claude/rules/error-handling.md, .claude/specs/auth/auth.sprint2.md
