/**
 * The list of every background worker, and what must be true before each one is
 * allowed to take a job.
 *
 * A worker is registered here, never started by its own file — each module
 * constructs its `Worker` with `autorun: false` and exports it, and this list is
 * what `index.js` walks. Adding a worker is one entry here plus one module; it
 * needs no change to `package.json`, which is the point: `npm run worker` runs
 * whatever is in this array.
 *
 * **`verify` is per worker, not shared.** The email worker cannot do its job
 * without SMTP and a real `CLIENT_ORIGIN`; a future worker that only touches
 * Postgres would be blocked by those checks for no reason. Each entry states its
 * own preconditions, and a failing one stops the whole process — a worker pool
 * where some workers silently did not start is worse than one that refuses to
 * boot, because the queue looks attended.
 *
 * See src/workers/index.js
