/**
 * Consumer side of the email queue — one BullMQ worker that routes a job name
 * to the message it sends.
 *
 * The processor's contract with BullMQ is expressed entirely through its
 * return value: returning marks the job completed and it is never retried,
 * throwing schedules another attempt under the queue's exponential backoff
 * (5 attempts, src/queues/email.queue.js). So the distinction below is not
 * stylistic — a revoked or already-accepted invitation *returns*, because no
 * number of retries will make it sendable, while an SMTP failure *throws*, so
 * the mail is tried again a few seconds later.
 *
 * Job payloads carry only ids and raw secrets, never rendered mail: the row
 * is read back here so the message reflects the workspace and inviter as they
 * are at send time, not as they were when the request came in.
 *
 * See .claude/rules/logging.md, src/queues/email.queue.js
 *      and src/shared/utils/mailer.js
