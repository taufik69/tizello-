/**
 * Project-scoped authorization. Resolves the two-layer ladder — the caller's
 * WORKSPACE role and their PROJECT role — once, in one place, so no service
 * anywhere grows an `if (role === …)` of its own.
 *
 * A new file rather than an addition to `permission.js`: that file is
 * workspace-scoped by construction and is imported by modules with no concept
 * of a project. Keeping the project ladder beside it, not inside it, leaves
 * both greppable.
 *
 * The ladder, in fixed order (see .claude/plan/project.md §2.5):
 *
 *   1. no workspace membership -> 404. A non-member never learns the project
 *      exists; confirming existence is itself the leak, exactly as
 *      `loadMembership` argues.
 *   2. workspace OWNER/ADMIN (PROJECT_MANAGE_ANY) -> full access to every
 *      project in the workspace. Without this escape hatch a workspace admin
 *      can be locked out of a project in their own workspace by a collaborator
 *      who removes them, recoverable only from the database.
 *   3. otherwise the project role decides — owner and MANAGER may write.
 *   4. workspace MEMBER with no ProjectMember row -> read-only. Projects are
 *      visible workspace-wide; there is no private-project flag in this schema.
 *
 * **Ownership is read from `req.project.ownerId` and nowhere else.** The
 * `ProjectMember` row with `role: OWNER` is a mirror kept for display (plan
 * §2.4); a `projectMember.role === 'OWNER'` check in this file would be a bug.
 *
 * All three run AFTER `authGuard`.
