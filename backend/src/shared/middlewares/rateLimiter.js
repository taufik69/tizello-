/**
 * Every rate limiter in the app, backed by Redis so the counters are shared
 * across processes.
 *
 * **Why Redis and not the default store.** `express-rate-limit`'s in-memory
 * store keeps a counter per process, so the real limit is `max × instances` and
 * every deploy resets it to zero. For a general API limiter that is merely
 * imprecise; for `authLimiter` it means "10 login attempts per 15 minutes" is
 * actually 10 per instance, and an attacker who keeps guessing across a rolling
 * deploy is never limited at all.
 *
 * **Why it fails CLOSED.** If Redis is unreachable these limiters reject rather
 * than wave traffic through. That is the opposite of the usual availability
 * instinct, and it is deliberate: a limiter that fails open is decorative
 * precisely when it matters, because "make Redis unavailable" is a cheaper
 * first step for an attacker than guessing passwords, and knocking out the
 * counter would unlock unlimited attempts. The cost is that a Redis outage
 * takes sign-in down — which is the correct trade for an auth surface, and is
 * documented in the failure table in docs/api/auth.md.
 *
 * **Why keys combine IP and email.** IP alone lets one attacker spread guesses
 * across a botnet; email alone lets a single IP walk a user list. The key
 * generator normalizes the email itself because the limiter runs *before* the
 * validator — `req.body` is not normalized yet at this point, so `Bob@X.com `
 * and `bob@x.com` would otherwise get separate budgets.
 *
 * See .claude/specs/auth/auth.sprint6.md §6.1–§6.2 and docs/api/auth.md
