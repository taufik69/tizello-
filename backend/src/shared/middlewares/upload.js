/**
 * Multipart handling for file uploads, configured once.
 *
 * Three decisions here are security, not preference:
 *
 * 1. **The stored filename is generated, never the client's.** A browser can
 *    send `../../etc/passwd` or `report.pdf.exe` as a filename, and `path.join`
 *    resolves the first one straight out of the upload directory. The original
 *    name is kept as METADATA for display and download; what touches the
 *    filesystem is `<cuid>.<ext>`, where the extension comes from an allowlist
 *    rather than from the name.
 * 2. **The size cap is enforced by multer, before the write.** A cap checked
 *    after the fact means the disk has already taken the hit.
 * 3. **The MIME type is allowlisted, not denylisted.** A denylist is a
 *    guarantee that the next format nobody thought of gets through.
 *
 * `diskStorage` rather than `memoryStorage`: a 10 MB file per concurrent
 * upload held in the heap is how an upload endpoint becomes a memory limit.
 *
 * See docs/api/upload.md
