/**
 * The two auth cookies, set and cleared in exactly one place.
 *
 * **The refresh cookie's `path` is the highest-value line in the whole auth
 * design** (plan §4.1). Scoped to `/api/v1/auth/refresh`, the browser attaches
 * the refresh token to that one endpoint and to nothing else — so a successful
 * XSS on any other route can read neither cookie (both are `httpOnly`) *and*
 * cannot cause the refresh token to be sent anywhere it could be observed. Set
 * it to `/` and nothing fails, no test goes red, and the blast radius of every
 * future XSS silently doubles. That is why it is a constant here rather than an
 * argument.
 *
 * Both cookies are `sameSite: 'lax'`.
 *
 * The refresh cookie was `strict`, on the reasoning that no cross-site context
 * has a legitimate reason to trigger token rotation. **OAuth is exactly such a
 * context, and it broke the flow.** The provider redirects the browser to
 * `/api/v1/auth/:provider/callback`, which is a cross-site navigation, so the
 * browser silently dropped every `strict` cookie that response tried to set —
 * no error, no warning. A user who signed in with Google got an access cookie
 * that worked for fifteen minutes and no refresh cookie at all, and then was
 * asked to log in again. Password sign-in hid the bug: that request is made
 * server-to-server by Next, which re-sets the pair onto its own origin, so no
 * cross-site rule applies.
 *
 * `lax` is not a meaningful loss here. It withholds the cookie from cross-site
 * *subrequests* and from cross-site POSTs; it sends it only on a top-level
 * navigation. `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` is a POST, so the one CSRF shape
 * `strict` was closing — a cross-site form or fetch rotating the session — is
 * closed by `lax` on this route too. What changes is that the OAuth callback's
 * own top-level navigation can now carry a `Set-Cookie` the browser keeps.
 *
 * Clearing must repeat the same `path`, `sameSite` and `domain` the cookie was
 * set with. A browser matches on those attributes, so a mismatched clear is a
 * silent no-op: the user believes they signed out and the cookie is still on
 * the machine.
 *
 * See .claude/specs/auth/auth.sprint1.md §1.4 and .claude/plan/authentication.md §4.1, §11.1
